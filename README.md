Assignment Applied Economic Analysis 1 (abstract)

This notebook analyses by means of a multisector Schumpeterian growth model the role creative destruction plays in the accumulation of an economy's stock of technology. By doing this, the model predicts an economy's long-term economic growth rate to be proportional to its advancement in technology. This conclusion further establishes earlier work on endogenous growth theory. A model by Phillipe Aghion and Peter W. Howitt served as the foundation for the model as presented here.
